JavaScript TTT
==============

This is a JavaScript implementation of the game Tic Tac Toe slightly themed to Rikki Tikki Tavi.

I chose JavaScript to gain more familiarity with Prototype-based programming (JavaScript OOP).

Playing
-------

There are four game modes to choose from:
* Human v Computer
* Computer v Human
* Human v Human
* Computer v Computer

Play the game [here](http://jsttt.herokuapp.com/)

Other Details
-------------

This is implemented as a simple Sinatra web application, but all game logic and display manipulation occurs through JavaScript.
